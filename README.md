# Smart Task Manager

## About

This project is all about adding, modifying, and deleting tasks. The design is simple, with added GIFs and charts. It is *responsive* from '342px' to 4K screen sizes.

This website features **user authentication** & **Real-time updates**, users can register and log in using an email address. Users can retrieve data from different devices and also receive real-time updates for tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> **This project is built using the latest version of NextJS with React. I used *Firebase Auth* for authentication, *Firebase Firestore* for CRUD operations and real-time updates, *Chakra-UI* for components and inline style, *chart.js* for chart representation, and *dayjs* for handling date operations.**
